The only thing that may seem odd to you is that I have late-bound all
FilsSystem objects. This is done because code compiled against IE5's
version of the scripting run-time breaks on an IE4 system if FSO 
objects are early-bound. 


Below are few things that I'd like to change about DirGraph, or that other users have requested...
Sorry if they make no sense at all.

Todo:  Improve speed
              Reuse scanned dir when scanning next highest
              Global FSO instead of constant create/destroy
              Don't use FSO?
       Up from drive with no parent = all [{local|network}] drives?
       Options [+ reg]:
              Show files as blocks is large enough to display
                     May need to limit number of files to limit no. of objects hanging around
                            Only track files over a certain size
                                   [and have a 'files to small' bin in each folder object]
              Show free-space as a block?
              All colours, not just highlight colours
              Colour whole block, not just outline
                     [outline looks 'neater', I think, but some users want whole block]
              Account for cluster sizes?
                     Can detect??
                         Store drive settings in reg?
                             i.e. c=4k, d=16k, e=2k...
              Automaticall may registry change to add to folder context menu
                     Should be an option, and easy for user to cancel
       Control:
              txtNew to combo:
                     'MRU' [in reg]
                     Custom options
                            All local drives
                            All drives
